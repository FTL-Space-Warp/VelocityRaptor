# VelocityRaptor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mithreindeir/VelocityRaptor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mithreindeir/VelocityRaptor)
(Travis isn't configured yet, thats why it says its failed).

**NOTE:** Work in progress engine, not ready for use, and still unstable (just finishing porting the C++ engine to C)/


Velocity Raptor is a 2D physics engine for games. Several solvers are available, including Projected Guass Seidel, and the Conjugate Gradient method at the moment. 

Planned features:

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics fluid simulation.

Joints. 

Current features:

SAT Collision detection.

Guass Seidel LPC solver.

Conjugate Gradient LPC Solver.

Accumulated Impulses solver;

Position correction.

Hash table

Dynamic arrays

linked lists

currently working on SPH.
